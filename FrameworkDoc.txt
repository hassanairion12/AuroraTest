This is the V0.0 of the Tets Automation Framework created specially for a test assignment requested by Aurora Solutions as an evaluation of skills.

The frameowrk uses Page Object Pattern and Factory paaterns and combines the two design patterns to create page object factory. 
Each screen has its own class and each class contains public methods to handle objects and events.
Test Data is defined in JSON pfiles and a TestdataCookBook class has been written to facilitate JSON parsing and converting json data into java objects.

Verification is done through TestNG assertions and fetching data by using selenuim webdriver methods.

As a demo Xpath has been used to identify web elements, although other method scould have been used.
